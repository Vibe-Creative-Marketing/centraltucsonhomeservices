      Ally and Che moved a whole room of my things from Hawaii to California. I was really nervous about the whole thing since it involved packing my things at my house, shipping it overseas, and delivering it...in California. However, they made the whole process really seamless and were really friendly and patient with me the entire time. They were super responsive via text and email, which was helpful, and they packed my stuff SUPER fast and were out of my place in no time. My stuff arrived safely and I'd definitely choose them if I ever have to move again...

      Honestly, I get stressed super easily and moving was more than I could handle. I couldn't find a lot of places that would move me from Hawaii to Minnesota without it being a complete hassle but ASAP Moving took a lot of the stress out of the process. Highly recommend.
